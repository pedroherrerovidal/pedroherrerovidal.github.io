I am a Ph.D.-qualified Applied Scientist at Amazon, specializing in cutting-edge Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to drive technical innovation and discovery.

In my previous roles and through my doctoral research, I developed neuro-inspired AI algorithms designed to extract actionable insights from complex datasets. My work has spanned a wide range of domains, including text, image, genomic, and neural activity data. Specific projects have involved entity resolution, region-of-interest (ROI) parsing, neural feature classification, identifying biomarkers for neurological diseases, and characterizing odor identity and intensity.

**Research interests**: Artificial Intelligence, Probabilistic and Sequential Data Modeling, Neuro-Inspired Technology, Transfer Learning, Signal Processing, Dimensionality Reduction and Generative Methods.
