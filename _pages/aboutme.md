I am Ph.D. qualified Applied Scientist at Amazon, working at the cutting-edge of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence promoting technical innovation and discovery.

As part of my prior experience and Ph.D. work, I engineered and developed ML algorithms to extract meaningful information from complex datasets. Part of my previous work involved dealing with text, images, genomic and neural activity data to perform entity resolution, parse  ROIs, neural feature classification, identify markers of neurological diseases and identify odor identity and intensity.
